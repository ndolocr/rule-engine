        This function takes MVEL Expressions from the 
        database and converts them into python understable statments.

        MVEL-style syntax isnâ€™t directly compatible with Pythonâ€™s eval. Specifically:

        1. MVEL Syntax Compatibility: MVEL uses operators like && 
        for logical "AND" and == for equality, which need to be replaced with and and == in Python.
        
        2. Dynamic Data Reference: Expressions such as 
        input.dr.transactionType == 'AirtelMoney' need to be adjusted so Python can properly access 
        nested dictionary values (e.g., input['dr']['transactionType']).
        
        3. Undefined Variables: Placeholder variables 
        like $(bank.target_done) need to be replaced with actual data from your input_objects.
